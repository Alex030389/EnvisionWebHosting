        <p>More than five years in the making, Envision Web Hosting is a collection of web hosting provider reviews,
          articles on doing business online and internet society, and a new resource for existing online businesses to
          take advantage of the changing scope of the Search Engine Marketing climate.</p>
        <p>When we first decided to start doing business online and get our faces in the eye of the all powerful search
          engines, we discovered that we spent most of our time picking ourselves up off the ground after continually
          tripping over the stumbling blocks of web hosting and basic search engine marketing in general. We have since
          taken our collective experiences with twenty-six of the top web hosting providers available to the global
          community, and have packaged our notes into tight and concise reviews with ratings and recommendations.</p>
        <p>We quickly discovered that a web host that is perfect for Client A, is not necessarily the best hosting
          provider for Client B. In order to determine what kind of host, and hosting plan you need to execute your
          business plan - you first need to fully understand what exactly you plan to do with your site online, and what
          additional steps you are willing to take to compliment your online business venture.</p>
        <p>Once you have determined the kind of host you need to thrive online, the next step is to actually begin that
          growing process and plant your seeds through some internet and search engine marketing. It is completely
          possible to drive traffic to your site without spending a dime on marketing or search engine optimization. The
          likelihood that a first-time online business will meet the criteria for this is not highly probable - but with
          some guidance it is possible.</p>
        <p>One classic winning business model combination would be to utilize a natural and free content flowing web
          site design that allows your content to be easily read and cataloged by roving search engine spiders/bots. Use
          a consistent linking strategy to send at least three to four outbound links to relevant high trust web sites,
          for each page that you have significant content on. Also, remember to steer clear of black hat SEO and
          marketing techniques. Understand that simply sharing an IP address (as with most shared hosting accounts) with
          an offender can reflect poorly upon you in the eye of the Search Engine and be painted guilty, by association.
          For this very good reason, we encourage serious site owners with aspirations of owning a high traffic web
          site, to use Dedicated Servers for hosting their projects - with the many varieties and options available
          today, this can be accomplished very economically.</p>
        <p>We want you to be successful, and welcome you to use any and all of the resources we have available on our
          site. Read and print our many articles, and find a web host that will take care of you and your site - even
          when you can't monitor the website itself. There are web hosting services that are available twenty-four hours
          a day - and we'll be happy to help you find them. It's your online business - do it right!</p>
